this is based on the database of themoviedb.org API( ​https://developers.themoviedb.org/3 ​)

Displaying a list of popular people (actors, directors)

The ability to search for people using any part of thier names

i use the httpclient from angular froms-moduls to fetch the data from the site

i use observable to keep any change of the data

also include bootstrap for the design to make the divs of all actors ( col-md-3 )

finally i use ng build --prod to minimize the size of the project but i also include the file of the original project

cause i work on angular framework itself i single commit of the whole project production and the code itself

please notice that i didn't upload the node_modules file ( it's too large for the free repository size )
